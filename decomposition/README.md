 CPU involves libraries of TensorLy(python) and TensorLab(matlab) for tensor decompositions

 In GPU, basic operations include khatri-Rao product, Kronecker product, Hadmard product.
     
	large contains our strategy for handle large scale tensor decompositions
     
        normal contains our optimized CP decomposition and Tucker decomposition

        unopt is our baseline version for tensor decompositions
